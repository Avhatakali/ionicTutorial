  <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
   <p>
     <br> Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command line utility (the “CLI”),
    and use Cordova to build/deploy as a native app. This means we need to install a few utilities to get developing.
    Getting Node.JS and NPM
    Most of the tooling in the CLI is based on Node and is managed through npm. 
    The quickest way to get Node and NPM installed on your machine is through the NodeJS installer. 
    Be sure to install the LTS version of Node. Close any terminals/command prompts you may have open, run the installer, and launch a new terminal window. 
    To verify you have everything installed correctly, 
    you can run npm --version and node --version. If this errors, please resolve before moving on. </p>
<br>
    <h3>Ionic CLI and Cordova</h3> 
     <p>With Node and NPM setup, let’s install the Ionic and Cordova CLI.The following commands are written on 'cmd/comannd prompt'</p> 
      <li>$ npm install -g ionic cordova</li> 
<br>
    <p> Note: The -g means this is a global install, so for Windows you will need to open command prompt/cmd. For Mac/Linux, you might need to run the command with sudo.
    Once that’s done </p>
<br>
    <h3>create your first Ionic app:</h3> 
      <li>$ ionic start helloWorld blank</li> 
      <li> $ ionic start helloWorld sidemenu</li>
      <li> $ ionic start helloWorld tabs</li>
<br>
   <h3>To run your app</h3>  
    cd into the directory that was created and then run the ionic serve command to test your app right in the browser!
<br>
    <h4>navigate to directory where yuh created your app</h4> 
     <li>$ cd helloWorld</li> 
     run the app
     <li>$ ionic serve</li>
